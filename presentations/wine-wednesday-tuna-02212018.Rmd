# The Process

`r div(id='logo-footer-white')`

# Project Objective(s)
`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`
Conduct a full bio-economic evaluation of alternative scenarios for the institutional structure of the tuna fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean with bycatch reduction as a primary goal.

--
  - Status quo
  
  - FAD taxes
  
  - Transferable effort quotas
  
  - Transferable catch quotas
  
  - Transferable relative quotas

# The Final Hour

`r div(id='logo-footer-white')`

---

# Theory
`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`

**Overfishing:** Vessels do not adequately account for the externalities caused by their catches depleting fish stocks

--

**Fishery Management Tool:** Limit short-term catches in service to long-term ecological, economic, and social objectives

  - Can be accomplished more efficiently with catch-based management instruments 

---
# Theory: C vs. E
`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`
$Externalities \propto catches$
--

* Unless all vessels have the same CPUE, difficult to offset with a $single fee \propto effort$

# Theory: C vs. E
`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`

* The "Wedge" (aka the theoretical advantage of catch-based instruments relative to effort-based instruments), should depend on two factors: 

    1. Size of costs from depleting stock in the future ("externalities") relative to benefits of catch now
    
    2. Degree to which effort-based instruments capture these costs ("externalities")

---

## Size of the Wedge: Theoretical

To measure the size of the externalities relative to the benefits...

$Z_j$ : Tax/Revenue

  - Ratio between the price that a vessel would pay per unit effort under the best catch-based policy, and the revenue it would receive under the best catch-based policy

$$Z_j = \frac{\lambda_{cj}}{R_{cj}}$$

`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`

---

## Size of the Wedge: Theoretical

To measure the degree to which an effort-based policy can capture capture the externality costs...

$\epsilon_j$ : Effort tax/Catch tax

  - Proportional difference between the price that a vessel pays per unit effort under the best effort-based policy, compared to the best catch-based policy

$$\epsilon_j = 1 - \frac{\lambda_e}{\lambda_{cj}}$$

`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`

---

## Size of the Wedge: Theoretical

$$W = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{J}\epsilon_{j}^2 Z_{j}^2 \omega_{j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{J}(1-Z_{j})^2 \omega_j}$$

- Note the weighted averages of square terms!  

- Intuition is that prices of catch and effort quotas/taxes each represent/measure marginal benefits or costs  

- Since the wedge compares total benefits or costs --> higher dimension

`r div(id='logo-footer-black')`

### Both values generally less than 1, wedge will be quite small (<10%) or quite large (>50%)!
